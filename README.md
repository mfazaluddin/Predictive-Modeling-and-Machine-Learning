# Predictive Modeling and Machine Learning  

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on applying predictive modeling and machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret datasets. Each project highlights a unique approach to data exploration, modeling, and visualization.  

## **Contents**  
1. **`01_Borrower_Distribution_Visualization.html`**  
   - Explores borrower distribution across counties using histograms and box plots.  
   - Identifies significant borrowing patterns and disparities.  

2. **`02_Regression_Correlation_Analysis.html`**  
   - Implements linear and logistic regression models.  
   - Analyzes demographic data correlations and their impact on surgery outcomes.  

3. **`03_Clustering_Blood_Type_Data.html`**  
   - Applies K-Means clustering to study patterns in blood type and age distribution.  
   - Discusses the lack of correlation between blood type and age.  

4. **`04_Temperature_Based_Day_Prediction.html`**  
   - Develops a decision tree model to predict days based on temperature and seasonal data.  
   - Evaluates model performance and overfitting challenges.  

5. **`05_SVM_Kernel_Performance_Comparison.html`**  
   - Compares SVM kernels (linear, RBF, polynomial) on medical dataset classifications.  
   - Concludes that the RBF kernel best captures complex relationships in the data.  

6. **`06_Random_Forest_Model.html`**  
   - Implements a random forest model to classify target data with high accuracy.  
   - Visualizes a single decision tree for better interpretability.
